# Moniker Marmot

___

Projects are hard to name. Moniker Marmot will help you find a namesake mascot that will give your project a little zazz.

This site uses SQLite, PHP, JavaScript (including jQuery & AJAX), HTML5, and CSS3 (including Flexbox).

Thanks to Treehouse for the "[Integrating PHP with Databases](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/integrating-php-with-databases)" course presented by Alena Holligan.
